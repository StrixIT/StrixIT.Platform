# StrixIT.Platform

This is the repository for the Strix Web Application Platform. It contains no modules, these have their own repositories. Use this repository to create your own modular application or contribute to the platform. Or use it to see how I solved the challenges involved in building a modular platform.

Please check out the documentation at https://www.strixit.com/manual if you want to learn more about the platform and how to work with it.
